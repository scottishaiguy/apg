As temperatures drop and winter approaches Edinburgh, it's crucial to ensure your vehicle is prepared for the challenging Scottish driving conditions. At Ainslie Park Garage, we've been helping motorists navigate Scottish winters for nearly 50 years. Here's our comprehensive guide to winter car maintenance.

## Battery Care

Cold weather is particularly harsh on car batteries. The low temperatures can reduce battery capacity by up to 50%, making it harder to start your engine on frosty mornings.

**What to check:**
- Battery terminals for corrosion
- Charge level and overall condition
- Connection security

**Our recommendation:** Visit us for a free battery health check before winter sets in. We'll test your battery's cold cranking amps and advise if replacement is needed.

## Tyre Preparation

Proper tyre maintenance is essential for safe winter driving in Edinburgh, where conditions can change rapidly from dry roads to ice and snow.

**Key considerations:**
- Minimum tread depth of 3mm for winter driving (legal minimum is 1.6mm)
- Check for uneven wear patterns
- Consider winter tyres for frequent rural driving

**Pressure checks:** Check tyre pressures weekly in winter, as cold temperatures cause pressure to drop.

## Antifreeze and Coolant System

Your car's cooling system needs proper protection against freezing temperatures.

**Essential checks:**
- Antifreeze concentration (should protect to at least -25°C)
- Coolant level and condition
- Hose integrity and radiator condition

**Professional tip:** Use a 50/50 mix of antifreeze and water for optimal protection in Scottish winters.

## Windscreen and Wipers

Visibility is crucial during winter months, with shorter daylight hours and potentially hazardous weather conditions.

**Maintenance checklist:**
- Replace worn wiper blades
- Use winter-grade screen wash (protects to -10°C)
- Check for chips and cracks in the windscreen
- Ensure heater and demister functions work properly

## Lights and Electrics

With darker evenings and mornings, properly functioning lights are essential for safety.

**What to verify:**
- All exterior lights (headlights, brake lights, indicators)
- Interior lights and dashboard illumination
- Fog lights (clean and aligned correctly)

## Emergency Kit Essentials

Every Scottish driver should keep an emergency kit in their vehicle during winter months.

**Recommended items:**
- Ice scraper and de-icer
- Warm blankets and extra clothing
- Torch with spare batteries
- Jump leads
- First aid kit
- Non-perishable snacks and water
