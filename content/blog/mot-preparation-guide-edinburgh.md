As an official MOT testing centre in Edinburgh, we've seen countless vehicles pass and fail their annual MOT tests. At Ainslie Park Garage, we want to help you pass first time, saving you money and hassle. Here's our comprehensive guide to MOT preparation.

## Understanding the MOT Test

The MOT (Ministry of Transport) test is a mandatory annual safety check for vehicles over three years old. It's not a service – it's a safety inspection that ensures your vehicle meets minimum road safety standards.

**What's checked:**
- Brakes, steering, and suspension
- Tyres and wheels
- Lights and electrical equipment
- Exhaust system and emissions
- Seat belts and safety restraints
- Body structure and condition
- Driver's view of the road

## Common MOT Failures and How to Avoid Them

### 1. Lighting Issues (30% of failures)

**What to check:**
- All headlights (main and dipped beam)
- Brake lights, including the third brake light
- Indicators (front and rear)
- Fog lights (must work but can be removed for test if faulty)
- Number plate lights

**Quick fix:** Clean all light lenses and check for blown bulbs. Replace any faulty bulbs before your test.

### 2. Tyre Problems (25% of failures)

**Critical checks:**
- Tread depth: Minimum 1.6mm across the central three-quarters
- Condition: No cuts, bulges, or cord exposure
- Pressure: Correct for your vehicle (check handbook)
- Matching: Same type and structure on each axle

**Pro tip:** Use the 20p test – insert a 20p coin into the tread grooves. If you can see the outer band, your tyres are likely illegal.

### 3. Brake System Issues (20% of failures)

**What to listen/feel for:**
- Grinding or squealing noises
- Pulling to one side when braking
- Soft or spongy brake pedal
- Warning lights on dashboard

**Our advice:** If you notice any brake issues, get them checked immediately – don't wait for the MOT.

### 4. Windscreen and Wiper Failures (15% of failures)

**Essential checks:**
- No chips or cracks larger than 10mm in driver's line of sight
- Wiper blades in good condition
- Screen wash reservoir full and working
- No obstructions to driver's view

**Quick fix:** Replace worn wiper blades and top up screen wash before your test.
