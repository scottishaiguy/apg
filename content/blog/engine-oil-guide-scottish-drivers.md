Engine oil is the lifeblood of your vehicle's engine, yet many drivers don't fully understand its importance or how to maintain it properly. At Ainslie Park Garage, we believe educated customers make better decisions about their vehicle maintenance. Here's our comprehensive guide to engine oil for Scottish drivers.

## What Engine Oil Actually Does

Engine oil performs several critical functions that keep your engine running smoothly:

### Primary Functions
- **Lubrication:** Reduces friction between moving parts
- **Cooling:** Carries heat away from critical components
- **Cleaning:** Traps and suspends harmful particles
- **Sealing:** Fills gaps between piston rings and cylinder walls
- **Protection:** Prevents corrosion and rust

### Why It's Especially Important in Scotland
Scottish driving conditions present unique challenges:
- Stop-start city driving in Edinburgh
- Short journeys that don't fully warm the engine
- Variable weather conditions from mild to freezing
- Hilly terrain that puts extra strain on engines

## Understanding Oil Types

### Mineral Oil
- **What it is:** Refined crude oil
- **Best for:** Older vehicles or gentle driving
- **Pros:** Lowest cost
- **Cons:** Breaks down faster, less protection

### Semi-Synthetic Oil
- **What it is:** Blend of mineral and synthetic oils
- **Best for:** Most modern vehicles
- **Pros:** Good balance of cost and performance
- **Cons:** Not as durable as full synthetic

### Full Synthetic Oil
- **What it is:** Chemically engineered oil
- **Best for:** High-performance engines, extreme conditions
- **Pros:** Superior protection, longer life
- **Cons:** Higher cost

## Understanding Oil Viscosity Ratings

The numbers on oil bottles (like 5W-30) tell you about the oil's viscosity:

### The First Number (5W)
- **W stands for Winter**
- Lower number = better flow in cold weather
- Critical for Scottish winters
- 5W oil flows well at -30°C

### The Second Number (30)
- **Viscosity at operating temperature**
- Higher number = thicker when hot
- Must match manufacturer specifications

### Common Scottish Recommendations
- **Winter:** 5W-30 or 5W-40
- **All-season:** 10W-40
- **High-performance:** 0W-30 or 5W-30

## Oil Change Intervals: The Scottish Context

### Manufacturer Guidelines
Most manufacturers recommend:
- **Modern cars:** Every 12,000-15,000 miles or 12 months
- **Older cars:** Every 6,000-10,000 miles or 6 months

### Scottish Driving Adjustments
Consider more frequent changes if you:
- Do mostly short journeys (under 10 miles)
- Drive in heavy Edinburgh traffic
- Experience extreme temperature changes
- Drive in dusty or rural conditions

**Our recommendation:** Every 8,000-10,000 miles or 8-10 months for typical Scottish driving.

## Signs Your Oil Needs Changing

### Visual Indicators
- Oil appears dark and gritty
- Metal particles visible on dipstick
- Milky appearance (indicates coolant leak)

### Performance Signs
- Engine noise increases
- Oil pressure warning light
- Reduced fuel efficiency
- Excessive exhaust smoke

### Dashboard Warnings
- Oil pressure light
- Service reminder
- Engine management light

## How to Check Your Oil

### Step-by-Step Guide
1. **Park on level ground** and wait 5 minutes after turning off engine
2. **Locate dipstick** (usually yellow or orange handle)
3. **Pull out dipstick** and wipe clean
4. **Re-insert fully** and pull out again
5. **Check level** between MIN and MAX marks
6. **Assess condition** (colour and clarity)

### What's Normal vs. Problematic
- **Normal:** Amber colour, transparent
- **Concerning:** Dark brown but still transparent
- **Problematic:** Black, gritty, or milky

## Common Oil Problems in Scottish Vehicles

### Short Journey Syndrome
Edinburgh's city driving often means:
- Engines don't reach full operating temperature
- Moisture accumulates in oil
- Increased sludge formation

**Solution:** Take longer journeys weekly or use synthetic oil.

### Temperature Extremes
Scottish weather can swing from -10°C to 25°C:
- Cold starts stress oil
- Heat breaks down oil faster
- Viscosity changes affect protection

**Solution:** Use multi-grade synthetic oil.

- Capacity requirements

### Consider Your Driving Style
